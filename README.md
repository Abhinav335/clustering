# Clustering-Using-PyCaret
Using PyCaret to compare different Clustering Algorithms on the Seeds Dataset.

#### Metrics Used
**1. Silhouette Score**: This measures how well data points are assigned to their clusters by considering both intra-cluster distance (similarity) and inter-cluster distance (dissimilarity). It ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better clustering.     
       
**2. Calinski-Harabasz Index**: This compares the average distance between clusters to the average distance within clusters. Higher values indicate better separation between clusters. 
           
**3. Davies-Bouldin Index**: This measures the ratio of the within-cluster distance to the between-cluster distance. Lower values indicate tighter and better-separated clusters.
